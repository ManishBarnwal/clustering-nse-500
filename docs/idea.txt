Cluster to find similar companies

Idea: 
Each company can be representedÂ  by few metrics(ideally) that would define the health of the company. Metrics like eps, revenue, market-cap, last 4 quarter earnings, RoE, PE ratio, etc. There could be other metrics or features as well. If we represent each company with these metrics and apply clustering on this data, would the clusters generated be meaningful.
We know we have companies like Bajaj Finance which has given excellent returns in the past and is continuing to do so. There would be other companies like this. Would it be possible that companies like Bajaj Finance will be clubbed into one cluster. 

Objective: 
Find the characteristics of each cluster by looking at few known companies mapped in each cluster and try to see which not-so-famous companies can be found in the same cluster. 

Approach:
Which companies to select in data?
	We start with top 500 NSE companies. Get list of top 500 companies.

Where to extract the data from? Screener, Yahoo, Moneycontrol. Use requests and beautifulsoup library

What features to use for clustering? Start w/ basic set of features that are easier to get. I will build on this later. 		Good now is better than perfect tomorrow.

Features: 
	Sector, market-cap, eps, roe, pe, debt/equity ratio
	Last 4 quarter earnings
	Price info: mean price, std, 25 %ile price, median price, 75 %ile price, 52 week high, 52 week low
	Volume traded
